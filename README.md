# French Wiktionary

This projects aims at casting the French language data of Wiktionary into an OWL ontology.

## Abstract

The [French Wiktionary](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionnaire:Page_d%E2%80%99accueil) is an immense source of lexical knowledge about the French language. Its community model allowed it to reach a broad coverage of the language, making it one of the best sources available online. Moreover, it's open-sourced. Yet, its content is hardly machine readable, preventing its usage in general application. We tackle this by parsing the Wiktionary data and populating an handcrafted grammatical/lexical ontology.
